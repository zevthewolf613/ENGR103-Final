# ENGR103-Final
All the code for ENGR 103 Spring term final project

This is a simple two player game. To play, upload the code, and both players hold down their buttons to start the game. When the white lights flash on the borad, press your button. Be the first to press your button and get a point! Be careful, if you shake your board too much when pressing your button or in between rounds, you may lose out on a point. Points will be tallied thoughout the 31 rounds of the game, and the winner will be revealed at the end of the game!

Depositories used in this project are the Adafruit Circuit Payground and the Talk_US_Male library.
